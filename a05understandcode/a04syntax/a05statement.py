"""
Expression Statement: a = 5 + 3 evaluates the expression 5 + 3 and assigns the result to a.
Assignment Statement: Assigns values to variables, like x = 10 and y = x + 5.
Conditional (if-else) Statement: Checks the value of x and prints corresponding messages.
Looping (for and while) Statements: Loops through numbers with both for and while loops.
Break, Continue, Pass: Demonstrates continue (skips the current iteration), break (exits the loop), and pass (does nothing, placeholder).
Function Definition: Defines the greet() function and calls it with a name.
Return Statement: A function add() returns the sum of two numbers.
Import Statement: Imports the math module and uses math.sqrt() to compute the square root.
Exception Handling: Uses a try-except block to handle potential errors (like division by zero).
Lambda Statement: Defines an anonymous function that squares a number.
With Statement: A context manager (normally used for file handling), though commented out in this code.
Global Statement: Demonstrates modifying a global variable using the global keyword.
Nonlocal Statement: Shows how nonlocal is used to modify a variable in the nearest enclosing scope.
Assertion Statement: Checks conditions and raises an AssertionError if the condition is False.
