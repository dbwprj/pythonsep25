Key PEP 8 Guidelines 

Imports are on top of the file. If there were more imports, we would group them into standard libraries, third-party libraries, and application-specific imports.
Each import is on a separate line.

Class names follow the CapWords convention. Each word in the class name starts
 with a capital letter.

 Method and function names are written in lowercase with words separated by underscores 
 (snake_case).

Docstrings:

Each class and method includes a docstring (triple quotes) that
describes its purpose and behavior. Docstrings are placed immediately 
after the function or class definition.

Line Length:
Lines should not exceed 79 characters. If they do, break them into
multiple lines (e.g., long strings or function calls). In this example,
the lines are kept short to maintain readability.

Blank Lines:
Two blank lines are used before class and function definitions to separate them from the surrounding code. This improves readability.
One blank line is used to separate methods within the class.

Variable names are written in lowercase, with words separated by underscores.

things to avoid
Use of Mixed Case in Variables:
For example, using userName instead of user_name.

Long Lines:
Lines exceeding 79 characters make the code hard to read and should be avoided. Break long expressions into multiple lines.

Too Little or Too Much Whitespace:
There should be no extra spaces around parentheses, function calls, or assignments.

Inconsistent Naming:
The code should consistently use either snake_case 
(for variables and function names) or
CamelCase (for classes) â€” not a mixture of both.
